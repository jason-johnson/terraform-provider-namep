  This data resource creates a map of maps of variables for locations: locs and locs_from_display_name.  The locations will be fetched from the specified (or active if none specified) Azure
  subscription unless static is set to true.
  If static is set to true, the locations that were build with the namep provider will be used.  Note that the static values can get out of date since they cannot be changed without a new version of the provider.  Also note that if static is
  set to true in the provider, it will be used regardless of the value in the data source.  There will, however, be no conflict between the provider static field and the subscription fields in this datasource.
  The main use of this provider is to create these location maps to be passed to the variable_maps parameter in the namep_configuration configuration.md data source.  Alternatively, it could be assigned to a locals variable to
  add other maps for the variable_maps parameter.
  locs
  This is a map from the Azure location name (e.g. "eastus") to a short name (e.g. "eus").  The short name is created by changing directions (e.g. "east") to a single letter and countries to their top level domain code (generally
  the same as the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code).
  locs_from_display_name
  This is a map from the lowercase display name of the location (e.g. "east us") to the Azure location name (e.g. "eastus").  This is useful for users that want to use the display name in their configuration but need the Azure location name.
  Note this cannot be used to go from display name to short name since the namestring function does not support double map lookups.
  Common use
  These variables are generally for use in formats to put a short form of the location in the computed name.  For example, a variable might be defined called LOC which will have the azure name of the location of the resource.  The format would then
  have {LOCS[LOC]} present to convert this azure location name to its short form to reduce the size of the name.

# namep_azure_locations (Data Source)

This data resource creates a map of maps of variables for locations: [locs](#locs) and [locs_from_display_name](#locs_from_display_name).  The locations will be fetched from the specified (or active if none specified) Azure
subscription unless `static` is set to true.
If `static` is set to true, the locations that were build with the namep provider will be used.  Note that the static values can get out of date since they cannot be changed without a new version of the provider.  Also note that if `static` is
set to true in the provider, it will be used regardless of the value in the data source.  There will, however, be no conflict between the provider `static` field and the subscription fields in this datasource.

The main use of this provider is to create these location maps to be passed to the `variable_maps` parameter in the [namep_configuration](configuration.md) data source.  Alternatively, it could be assigned to a `locals` variable to 
add other maps for the `variable_maps` parameter.

## locs

This is a map from the Azure location name (e.g. "eastus") to a short name (e.g. "eus").  The short name is created by changing directions (e.g. "east") to a single letter and countries to their top level domain code (generally
the same as the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code).

## locs_from_display_name

This is a map from the lowercase display name of the location (e.g. "east us") to the Azure location name (e.g. "eastus").  This is useful for users that want to use the display name in their configuration but need the Azure location name.
Note this cannot be used to go from display name to short name since the `namestring` function does not support double map lookups.

## Common use

These variables are generally for use in formats to put a short form of the location in the computed name.  For example, a variable might be defined called `LOC` which will have the azure name of the location of the resource.  The format would then
have `{LOCS[LOC]}` present to convert this azure location name to its short form to reduce the size of the name.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "namep_azure_locations" "example" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `static` (Boolean) Static flag to determine if the data source should be static (cannot be used with `subscription_display_name` or `subscription_id`).
- `subscription_display_name` (String) Subscription Display Name to pull locations from (cannot be used with `subscription_id` or `static`).
- `subscription_id` (String) Subscription ID to pull locations from (cannot be used with `subscription_display_name` or `static`).

### Read-Only

- `location_maps` (Map of Map of String) Maps of maps for location substitutions, as described above.
